question: |
  Private Information
subquestion: |
  To protect privacy, you **cannot** include personal identifying information in public documents that are filed in court. Personal identifying information includes:
 
  * Date of birth
  * Social security or national identification number
  * Driver’s license or state identification number
  * Passport number
  * Financial account numbers
  
  If a question doesn't specifically ask for personal identifying information, do not include it in your answers. If this type of information is needed, this tool will specifically ask for the information and it will go on a separate non-public form that you will file along with the other documents. This DIY tool will automatically produce that form if you need it.
  
  Do you understand that you should only enter personal identifying information if this tool specifically asks for it?

question: |
  You Must Already Have a Court Case to Use This Tool
subquestion: |
  A motion is a way to ask a judge to do something in an existing court case. You cannot use a motion to start a new case. You will need information such as the judge, court, and case number of the ongoing case to fill out a motion. It will help if you have other documents from the case (like the complaint, petition, or answer) nearby so you can look for information there.
  
  Do you have an existing case in a Michigan court?
yesno: Already_Have_a_Court_Case

event: already_have_case_must_agree
question: |
  You cannot continue to use the tool.
subquestion: |
  Based on your answer, you can't use this tool to make a Notice of Hearing and Motion. You must already have a case in court to file a motion. Michigan Legal Help may have information about starting the kind of case you need. Use the Guide to Legal Help to search for information or to find a lawyer or legal services in your area.

  Make Sure this Tool is Right for Your Situation
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you prepare a general motion if there is not a more specific form to use. There are some types of motions that have specific requirements. 
  
  Michigan Legal Help has some tools to help you draft more specific motions. The more specific tools will help you make sure that you do the best job you can of meeting the requirements of that kind of motion. If there is a specific tool, you should use that tool instead of this one. Review the tools at the link below carefully to find out if there is a specific motion tool you should use:
  
  Follow this link to a list of all the tools on Michigan Legal Help.
  
  Do any of the tools on that page fit what you are trying to do?
  
  Yes → This tool is not right for you. Instead of using this tool to prepare a motion, please follow the link above that applies to you. 
  If you made a mistake, change your answer above to continue. Otherwise, click Exit.

  Did you find a form that applies to your case?
  
  Yes → This tool is not right for you. Instead of using this tool to prepare a motion, please use the SCAO-approved form that applies to your case.

id: You May Want to Speak with a Lawyer
question: |
  You May Want to Speak with a Lawyer
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you to fill out a Notice of Hearing and Motion. There are many kinds of motions. Some have specific things you need to prove, and if you do not meet all of the requirements the judge will not grant your motion. 
  
  This tool will not guide you through the legal elements that you would need to show to have a judge grant your motion because that depends on the kind of case and kind of motion you are filing. This tool will only help you fill in the form. What you write and argue is up to you.
  
  You may want to speak to a lawyer. You can use the Guide to Legal Help to find a lawyer or legal services office in your area if you want more help.

id: Motion Title
question: |
  Motion Title
subquestion: |
  Fill in the blank below with the title of your motion. This must be short and fit on one line. It should briefly tell the judge what you are asking for. 
  
  A motion is a document you use to ask the judge to do something. If you are having trouble deciding what to name the motion, think of the word “Motion” as meaning “I want to ask the judge” For example, if you are getting divorced and want to waive the waiting period you might  say “I want to ask the judge to waive the statutory waiting period.” In that situaiotn the motion title could be “Motion to Waive the Statutory Waiting Period.”
  
  Motion [blank line with a character limit of 85, optional field]
  
  If you are not sure of the title you can leave this blank and neatly write it by hand before you file it in court.
fields:
  - "Motion Title": motion_title
    maxlength: 81
---
id: Your Motion
question: |
  Your Motion
subquestion: |
  A motion is a written request to a judge. A motion must have a written statement that gives the judge reasons why they should do what you are asking. 
  
  Whether or not the judge grants your motion will depend on the facts and the laws that apply in your case. Your motion will be more persuasive if you are very clear about what you are asking for and give good legal support for your request. Here are a few ways to write a good motion:
  Start and end by directly asking for what you want. For example, you could start by saying: “I request that the court waive the waiting period in my divorce.” After writing the support for your request you could end by saying: “For all of the reasons listed above, I respectfully request that the court waive the waiting period in my divorce.”
  Be brief. Give good reasons why the judge should do what you are asking but make sure that you stay focused on the specific issues related to the request.
  Include attachments if they support your arguments. If you have a document or photo that supports a statement you make, you can attach an exhibit. For example, you could write: “My spouse has been physically abusive and I got a Personal Protection Order in 2019. See Exhibit A.” If you reference any exhibits in your motion be sure to label and attach them to your finished forms before filing in court. In the example here you would clearly write “Exhibit A” on a copy of the 2019 protection order and attach it to the motion.
  Do your best to understand what rules the judge will follow when deciding your motion. For example, if the law says that the judge can grant a motion in your case if you show a change in circumstances, be sure to explain the change in circumstances. If the court rules say you must show good cause, explain the good cause. It is a good idea to use those specific words. For example, if you need to show good cause, say “There is good cause because…”
  Do not include any personal identifying information. Personal identifying information includes: date of birth, social security or national identification number, driver’s license or state identification number, passport number, and financial account numbers. If a court rule or law requires you to include this information or if the information is necessary for identification purposes you must fill out form MC 97 (if the information is related to a defendant, respondent, or decedent) or form MC 97a (if the information is about a plaintiff, petitioner, or anyone else not included in MC 97). Include the information on MC 97 and do not include it in the Motion. Instead, include a reference in the Motion to ask the judge to see MC 97 for the information.
  
  Use the space below to tell the judge what you want and to give reasons for it. This tool will not automatically save your work. If you will need to spend some time writing you may want to create an account and save your work a few times as you write.
